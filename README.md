After creating and comparing two models on this data: a logistic regression, and a random forests classifier, I have been able to compare the two and see which would be a better fit for the data set given. 
 
### Conclusion:
The Logistic Regression model performed better. For the Random Forest Classifier model, the training score is higher, at a score of 0.9975. Yet, the testing score is 0.9915 which is lower than the Logistic Regression model, which has a score of 0.9921. Idealy, the testing score would be closer to that of the training score.
