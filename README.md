#### Project Background:
Lending services companies allow individual investors to partially fund personal loans as well as buy and sell notes backing the loans on a secondary market. You will be using this data to create machine learning models to classify the risk level of given loans. Specifically, you will be comparing the Logistic Regression model and Random Forest Classifier.

#### Findings:
After creating and comparing two models on this data: a logistic regression, and a random forests classifier, I have been able to compare the two and see which would be a better fit for the data set given. The Logistic Regression model performed better. For the Random Forest Classifier model, the training score is higher, at a score of 0.9975. Yet, the testing score is 0.9915 which is lower than the Logistic Regression model, which has a score of 0.9921. Idealy, the testing score would be closer to that of the training score.
